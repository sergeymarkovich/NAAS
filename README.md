  Network-as-a-service (NaaS) is a cloud service model. NaaS allows customers to operate their own networks without maintaining their own networking infrastructure.
   NaaS can replace virtual private networks (VPNs), multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) connections, or other legacy network configurations. It can also replace on-premise networking hardware such as firewall appliances and load balancers.
